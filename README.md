# Sentiment Analysis for Stock Prices

## Abstract
The Wall Street Journal is one of the premier trusted sources that many individuals use to be caught up on the current state of the financial markets in the US. It is very likely that amateur and retail investors consciously or subconsciously use this information to inform their trading decisions and how they value certain stocks. A tool that I think would be useful for the trading community to use is to implement NLP techniques on recent articles to determine whether the article indicates a buy or sell signal for the stock in question. I will test this tool by calculating the sentiment for many articles and analyzing the relationship between the sentiment and the corresponding change in stock prices.
