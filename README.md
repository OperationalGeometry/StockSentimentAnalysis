## Abstract
The Wall Street Journal is one of the premier trusted sources that many individuals use to be caught up on the current state of the financial markets in the US. It is very likely that amateur and retail investors consciously or subconsciously use this information to inform their trading decisions and how they value certain stocks. A tool that I think would be useful for the trading community to use is to implement NLP techniques on recent articles to determine whether the article indicates a buy or sell signal for the stock in question. I will test this tool by calculating the sentiment for many articles and analyzing the relationship between the sentiment and the corresponding change in stock prices.

## Method
Does historical stock price data in the short-term correlate with the overall sentiment of an article with the stock in question? Sentiment Analysis as a tool for trading signals has been done before. A unique approach that I am utilizing is the incorporation of RSS feeds to trigger the web scraper to pull the text. I will use NLP tokenization to greedily extract the company name and corresponding ticker from the title of the article. I will then use the transformers library to calculate the sentiment of the article. I will then use the yfinance library to issue API calls to receive stock data between the time the article was posted and the current time. I will then plot the relationship between the sentiment of the stock in question and the change in price, to see if there are any interesting trends.
